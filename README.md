# coding-assessment

## Description:

For this project, I was instructed to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. My goal is to address the above points, along with proper deployment, and application and repo quality.

Everything hereafter was done in JavaScript. To start, I explored this week's mini project and built my html, css, and JavaScript on the points we learned throughout the week and created the code structure from there. This included concepts such as jQuery. The above was based on the conditionals/requirements provided in this week's module.

Moving beyond this, I then built out my JavaScript creating functions that start the quiz, control the timer, end the game, store user initials and scores, and the like. After this, I tested the site several times, answering all possible options to find any edge cases.

My primary goals throughout the above processes include:
when user takes the quiz; a timer starts and a question is presented upon clicking start button; when user answers a question they are presented with another question; when answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock;
once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game ends; once the game ends user is prompted to save initials and score.

Throughout this entire process, I added relevant comments in the JavaScript; these comments act as snippets of the general outline of the content herein.
